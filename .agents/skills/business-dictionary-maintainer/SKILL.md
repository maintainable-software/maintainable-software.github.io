# Business Dictionary Maintainer

Use this skill whenever repository docs or instructions introduce, rename,
redefine, or remove important repository terminology that matters to
understanding the repository.

## Workflow

1. Read `docs/DICTIONARY.md`.
2. Identify which product concepts or meta/internal terms were introduced,
   changed, or removed by the current task.
3. When the task substantively changes docs in an area, do a coverage pass over
   the affected docs area instead of stopping at explicitly requested terms.
   Scan for stable product concepts and meta/internal terms the updated docs now
   rely on repeatedly or need for consistent linking.
4. Add, update, merge, or remove dictionary entries so `docs/DICTIONARY.md`
   remains the single canonical source for those terms.
5. Keep entries sorted alphabetically within their section.
6. Put a term in the first section when it names an actual thing, artifact,
   part, state, workflow, property, or relation intrinsic to the product/domain
   model, whether or not end users see it directly.
7. Put a term in the second section when it names how the repository classifies,
   scopes, designs, implements, operates, or documents those product concepts.
8. Do not add vague principle language, taste labels, or one-off grouping labels
   to the dictionary unless they are stable reference terms used repeatedly
   across docs and need canonical meaning.
9. If a term only labels a category of concepts rather than a concept the
   product actually has, prefer documenting the actual concepts instead of
   adding the category label as a dictionary entry.
10. When a term is easy to misunderstand, easy to misuse, or overloaded in
    everyday language, include a short usage example. Prefer a concrete command
    example when usage depends on a command.
11. If an entry describes a planned concept rather than a live implemented one,
    say that explicitly.
12. Prefer one important term per concept. Do not let near-synonyms blur
    distinct responsibility boundaries or fold multiple concepts into one
    overloaded term.
13. When editing prose under `docs/`, link important dictionary terms to their
    matching dictionary entries unless the term is being used as code, CLI
    syntax, or a file path in backticks.
14. Remove dictionary entries when the term is removed from the product or
    repository model entirely, and remove stale links to removed entries from
    the affected docs.

## Boundaries

- Use this skill for important repository terminology, not for general English
  words.
- Do not let `docs/DICTIONARY.md` accumulate near-synonyms for the same concept
  without clarifying the preferred term.
- Do not mix actual product concepts and meta/internal terminology into one
  flat glossary section.
- Do not promote principle headings, taste labels, or simple inventory labels
  into dictionary entries when they are not stable repository terms.
- Do not use one dictionary entry to hide multiple distinct concepts behind a
  single overloaded label.
- Do not restate code-level implementation details that belong in topic docs or
  co-located docs.
- Do not stop after updating terms the user mentioned explicitly when the
  surrounding docs now rely on additional stable terms that also meet the
  dictionary criteria.
- Keep examples short and practical.
