# Process Decisions

## Separate Routing From Explanation

`_index.md` exists to support routing and discoverability. `README.md` exists to
help a human understand the area. Keeping those roles separate makes each file
easier to maintain.

## Keep Status And Rationale Out Of `README.md`

`_status.md` and `_decisions.md` isolate information that changes for different
reasons than the core mental model. This avoids turning `README.md` into a
mixed-purpose document.

## Keep One Global Dictionary

The repository uses `docs/DICTIONARY.md` instead of per-folder glossaries so
terminology stays centralized and easier to keep consistent.

## Split Dictionary Terms By Conceptual Role

The repository keeps one global dictionary, but it does not flatten actual
product concepts and meta/internal terminology into one undifferentiated list.
The dictionary uses a first section for product concepts and a second section
for terms about scoping, design, implementation, operation, or documentation so
both kinds of terms can stay canonical without blurring what belongs to the
model itself.

## Dictionary Coverage Requires An Area Pass

Updating only the terms explicitly mentioned in a prompt is not enough once a
docs area relies on a broader stable vocabulary. After substantively changing
docs in an area, the workflow should scan that affected area for stable terms
now relied on repeatedly, add missing dictionary entries that meet the criteria,
link important uses, and remove stale links to removed entries.

## Preserve Conceptual Simplicity Across Docs And Implementation

The repository treats
[conceptual simplicity](../DICTIONARY.md#conceptual-simplicity) as more
important than technical or editorial convenience. Docs should not merge
distinct responsibilities just because they are adjacent in workflow or
convenient to explain together. The same rule should guide implementation
boundaries.

## Let Docs Mirror Responsibility Boundaries

When a system area has clear conceptual parts, the docs should use one focused
document per [system part](../DICTIONARY.md#system-part) plus a separate
[composition](../DICTIONARY.md#composition) document rather than one umbrella
document that mixes responsibilities. This keeps the docs usable as a design aid
rather than only as prose.
