# Process

Process docs define how repository documentation is structured, routed, and
maintained.

## Documents

### Process Overview

- Path: `docs/process/README.md`
- Summary: Human entrypoint for the documentation-process area, explaining what
  this area covers and how its documents fit together.
- Read when: You need the mental model for the repository's documentation
  workflow before going into detailed process rules.
- Tags: docs, process, overview, mental-model

### Process Status

- Path: `docs/process/_status.md`
- Summary: Current reality for the documentation-process area, including which
  workflow rules are active and where adoption is still incomplete.
- Read when: You need the present-state view of the docs process, known gaps, or
  active uncertainty.
- Tags: docs, process, status, current-state

### Process Decisions

- Path: `docs/process/_decisions.md`
- Summary: Rationale for separating routing, mental-model, status, and rationale
  docs in the process area.
- Read when: You need to understand why the docs process uses its current file
  roles and structural conventions.
- Tags: docs, process, decisions, rationale

### Conceptual Simplicity

- Path: `docs/process/conceptual-simplicity.md`
- Summary: Defines the repository's
  anti-[complecting](../DICTIONARY.md#complecting) rules for docs structure,
  terminology boundaries, and system-part responsibilities.
- Read when: The task affects architecture, [module](../DICTIONARY.md#module)
  boundaries, system decomposition, terminology boundaries, or how docs should
  be structured to preserve
  [conceptual simplicity](../DICTIONARY.md#conceptual-simplicity).
- Tags: docs, process, simplicity, complexity, boundaries

### Docs Routing

- Path: `docs/process/docs-routing.md`
- Summary: Defines how global docs routing works, including using structured
  `_index.md` entries to decide which docs should be read for a task.
- Read when: The task changes doc discovery, routing behavior, index shape, or
  how the minimum sufficient set of global docs should be selected.
- Tags: docs, routing, indexing, read-when, discovery

### Docs System

- Path: `docs/process/docs-system.md`
- Summary: Defines the repository documentation model, including global indexed
  docs under `docs/`, optional co-located docs, and the maintenance expectations
  for both.
- Read when: The task changes the overall documentation system, ownership of
  docs files, index maintenance rules, or the relationship between global and
  co-located docs.
- Tags: docs, system, maintenance, global-docs, colocated-docs

### Dictionary

- Path: `docs/DICTIONARY.md`
- Summary: Defines the canonical repository terminology used by this
  repository's own docs tree, split between product concepts and meta/internal
  terms.
- Read when: The task depends on repository terminology, term consistency,
  ambiguous concepts or internal language, or docs changes that introduce,
  rename, redefine, or remove important terms.
- Tags: docs, dictionary, terminology, glossary, product-concepts, meta-terms

### Colocated Docs

- Path: `docs/process/colocated-docs.md`
- Summary: Defines the naming convention, purpose, and conservative maintenance
  rules for optional `*.docs.md` files next to concrete source or configuration
  files.
- Read when: The task involves creating, reading, or updating co-located docs,
  or deciding whether file-specific documentation belongs next to code instead
  of in `docs/`.
- Tags: docs, colocated, module-docs, file-docs, maintenance

### Transitional Docs

- Path: `docs/process/transitional-docs.md`
- Summary: Explains how to work safely in repositories whose documentation
  structure is only partially normalized toward the indexed global docs model.
- Read when: The repository has legacy docs locations, missing docs indexes, or
  mixed documentation patterns that need to be interpreted or normalized.
- Tags: docs, transitional, legacy, migration, normalization
