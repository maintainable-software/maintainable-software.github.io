# Docs Routing

Preferred shape:

1. root `docs/_index.md`
2. area `_index.md`
3. area `README.md`
4. optional area `_status.md`
5. optional area `_decisions.md`
6. focused topic docs

Routing rules:

- `docs/_index.md` is the only always-read entry point for
  [global docs](../DICTIONARY.md#global-docs) when global docs are needed
- area `_index.md` files define local discoverability
- `README.md` is the human entrypoint for a docs folder and should explain what
  the area is, why it exists, and the core mental model
- `_status.md` captures present-state context, active uncertainty, known gaps,
  and open questions when that information matters
- `_decisions.md` captures important rationale and tradeoffs when that
  information matters
- each `_index.md` entry for an existing global doc should include `Path`,
  `Summary`, `Read when`, and `Tags`
- `docs/DICTIONARY.md` should be read when the task depends on repository
  terminology or terminology consistency
- `docs/process/conceptual-simplicity.md` should be read when the task affects
  conceptual boundaries, [module](../DICTIONARY.md#module) responsibilities,
  product decomposition, or docs structure
- `Read when` is the primary routing hint for deciding relevance
- `Summary` explains the document's scope and intended use
- `Tags` provide compact secondary routing signals
- topic docs should stay focused and small
- `README.md` is mandatory in every docs folder under `docs/`
- for each substantive prompt, global docs routing happens first
- global docs routing may correctly conclude that zero global docs need to be
  read
- if routing or reading reveals a meaningful contradiction or mismatch, it
  should be surfaced clearly even when contradiction-finding was not the user's
  primary request
- [co-located docs](../DICTIONARY.md#co-located-docs) are not part of the global
  routing tree and are discovered by adjacency when concrete files are opened

This pattern exists to minimize prompt noise while preserving discoverability.
