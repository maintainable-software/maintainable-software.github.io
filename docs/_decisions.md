# Docs Decisions

## `_index.md` Owns Routing

The repository uses `_index.md` instead of `README.md` for docs navigation so
routing metadata stays separate from human-oriented explanation.

## `README.md` Owns The Mental Model

Each docs folder uses `README.md` as the human entrypoint. This makes the file
name familiar and predictable without overloading it with routing duties.

## `_status.md` And `_decisions.md` Are Special-Purpose Docs

Current-state information and rationale change at different rates and for
different reasons. Keeping them out of `README.md` reduces drift and makes it
clearer where to update the truth.

## Keep The Workflow Docs Separate

The docs system keeps routing, maintenance rules, and terminology guidance in
separate files so each concern can be updated without braiding unrelated
responsibilities together.
